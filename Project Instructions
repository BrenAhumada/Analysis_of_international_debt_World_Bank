I will write SQL queries to answer the following questions:

1 - What is the number of distinct countries present in the database? The output should be single column aliased with the following name: total_distinct_countries.

2 - What are the distinct debt indicators? the output column should be aliased as distinct_debt_indicators and the outputs should be ordered by it.

3- What is the total amount of debt owed by all the countries present in the table, in millions? The output should be single column aliased with the following name: total_debt.

4- What country has the highest amount of debt?

5- What is the average amount of debt across different debt indicators?

6- What is the highest amount of principal repayments in the "DT.AMT.DLXF.CD" category?
